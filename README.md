# Backend/API with Node.js, Express.js, Prisma ORM, and MySQL

The goal of this tutorial is to help you get a better understanding of Express.js. You can use it to build secure and scalable APIs.
It comes without structure so developers face many difficulties and are confused about what folder structure they should use. My best practice and experience made it simple for you.

**Note:** Let me know if you've found any other best practices that are better than mine. It's my goal to make it easier to use for everyone.

## Key Features

1. User Authentication
2. Error Handling
3. Folder Structure

## What you'll learn:

1. ### Understanding Node.js and Express.js:

   This project teaches you how to build APIs with Node.js and Express.js. Creating routes, controllers, handling HTTP requests, and managing middleware will be covered.

2. ### Prisma ORM with MySQL:

   With Prisma, you'll learn how to interact with databases. With Prisma, you can define data models and perform CRUD operations quickly.

3. ### JWT Authentication:

   Implementing JWT-based authentication will give you a common authentication mechanism for API endpoints. User sessions and authorization can be managed securely with JWTs.

4. ### Error Handling Best Practices:
   Make sure you catch and handle errors gracefully. It prevents crashes and gives users meaningful feedback.
